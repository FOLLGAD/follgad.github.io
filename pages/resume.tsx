              Dework was a decentralized work platform that aimed to
              revolutionize how work is done. As a full-stack engineer I worked
              together with the founding engineer to build the platform from the
              ground up.
            </p>
            <p>
              The company later pivoted into Godmode, a B2B platform for AI
              Agents. There I also worked as a full-stack engineer.
